# There is no containerized `run`: bridge_mcp.py's whole job is to read/write the
# HOST's real ~/.claude/sessions and its real Unix sockets under
# /run/user/$(UID)/cc-socks to bridge real Claude Code sessions. A container gets
# its own isolated $HOME (on purpose, so tests can never touch real session
# state) - running the bridge itself in one would cut it off from everything it's
# meant to talk to. It's installed and run host-native via uvx/uv tool install.
